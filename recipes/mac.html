    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping is creamy and comforting. 
        It's easy to make the cheese sauce from scratch on your stovetop, starting with a roux and adding milk, 
        cheddar, and Parmesan, resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny of the noodles.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h4>Macaroni and Cheese</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>&#188 cup salted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2&#189 cups milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>&#189 cup finely grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Bread Crumb Topping</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>&#189 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350&degF. Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally,
            until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt &#188 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour
            and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk 2&#189 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar 
            and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until 
            cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to &#189 cup more milk if needed. 
            Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread 
            crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, 
            then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 
            minutes.</li>
    </ol>
