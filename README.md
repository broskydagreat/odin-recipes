This is the first project for The Odin Project, titled Recipes.

During this project and preceding lessons, I learned and implemented many "building-block" elements of an html website,
such as headings, lists, links, and images. I also learned the importance of adding meta-data like website titles and 
alternate descriptions for images to assist in navigation and recognition in various browsing modes. 

I was also able to gain comfort and cement my knowledge of various terminal commands and navigation, and the use of git 
within the terminal.

It was great to feel like I was absorbing the material the way it seemed like I should be!
